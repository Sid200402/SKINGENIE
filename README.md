# SKINGENIE
Skin Disease Detection Web Application

This web application is designed to detect various skin diseases using machine learning techniques. It allows users to upload an image of a skin lesion, which is then analyzed by a trained deep learning model to identify the disease and provide relevant information.

Features

	•	Image Upload: Users can upload images of skin lesions for analysis.
	•	Disease Detection: The uploaded images are processed using a deep learning model to detect the presence of various skin diseases.
	•	Medicine Recommendation: Based on the detected disease, the application recommends suitable medicines for treatment.
	•	User Interface: The web application provides a user-friendly interface for easy interaction.

Installation

	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone (https://github.com/Sid200402/SKINGENIE.git)


	2.	Navigate to the project directory:

cd skin-disease-detection


	3.	Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


	4.	Run the Flask application:

python app.py


	5.	Access the application in your web browser at http://localhost:3000.

Usage

	1.	Navigate to the home page (http://localhost:3000) in your web browser.
	2.	Sign in or sign up to access the dashboard.
	3.	Upload an image of a skin lesion on the dashboard.
